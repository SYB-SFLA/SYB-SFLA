### Hi there 👋:octocat:




**About me:**    

:point_right: During 2020, I became very interested :mag_right: in code and tech, learning on my own via tutorials and videos on Youtube among others :seedling:. 

:swimming_woman: I have decided to take the Pool competition at school 42 in Paris, in August 2020. An intensive and instructive month.   

:woman_technologist: I learned the Shell Linux language and the famous C language through the realization of projects :turtle: 	:rocket: and especially the peer-programming because there is no course, nor teachers :fishing_pole_and_fish:. 

Since June :spiral_calendar:, I am a student at the O'clock school to become a web and mobile web developper - fullstack Javascript :desktop_computer: :computer:  

The courses are remote, live and in a virtual room :family_man_man_girl_boy: that we call the cockpit :artificial_satellite:.

After 3 months :hourglass_flowing_sand: of learning the basics of web development, then a month of specialization in data/API during which I trained among others on the following technologies: 

- Linux environment via a virtual machine
- HTML and CSS language
- Javascript language on front-end & back-end
- Node Js environment on the back side and Express framework
- API Rest
- MVC architecture - Model View Controller
- DataMapper/ Active Record, ORM Sequelize, EJS/PUG
- PostgreSQL database, MongoDB, Sqitch
- Validator Joi, Regex
- Hosting platform AWS / Heroku / Firebase


During one month, my team and I designed a web application to consolidate our knowledge and skills. 
It's about the following repository: https://github.com/SYB-SFLA/oprojetheque

My current goal 🎯: to learn React to complete my training 💻 .

However, I am open to work opportunities 👩‍💻 🔌 in France :fr or Canada 🇨🇦 .

NB: project to develop a mobile application 📱 in no-code (Adalo) during 2022 :round_pushpine: :dart::rocket:
